# 🗄️ MongoDB_NoSQL - Project

## 📘 Purpose
The purpose of this MongoDB project is to provide **hands-on experience** with real-world database operations using MongoDB.  
It helps students understand how to **store, query, update, and analyze** data efficiently using MongoDB’s document-based model and aggregation framework.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how to create and manage **collections** in MongoDB.  
- Learn to use **filters and projections** for retrieving specific data.  
- Apply **$lookup** and **aggregation pipelines** to combine and summarize datasets.  
- Perform **update**, **upsert**, and **delete** operations.  
- Use **array operators** and **nested conditions** for complex queries.  
- Write **advanced analytical queries** using the aggregation framework.

## 🧾 Project Summary

### Collections Used
- 🧑‍🎓 `students_full.json`  
- 🧑‍🏫 `faculty_full.json`  
- 📚 `courses_full.json`  
- 📝 `enrollments_full.json`  
- 🎯 `activities_full.json`

## 💡 Practical Implementation
I have completed this project by connecting **Mongosh (MongoDB Shell)** with **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)**.  
All queries were written and executed directly on the **MongoDB Atlas cluster** using **Mongosh CLI**, ensuring a real-time cloud-based environment for data operations.

### Tasks Included
1. Complex Filters & Projections  
2. Joins ($lookup) and Aggregations  
3. Grouping, Sorting, and Limiting  
4. Update, Upsert, and Delete  
5. Array & Operator Usage  
6. Subdocuments and Nested Conditions  
7. Advanced Aggregation (Challenge Level)

### Workflow
1. Load all datasets into MongoDB.  
2. Write queries for all questions (Q1–Q14).  
3. Execute and test each query.  
4. Capture **screenshots** of results (with your name & registration number in comments).  
5. Combine queries and screenshots into a **Word/PDF report**.  
6. Upload via the official **Google Form** shared by your instructor.
